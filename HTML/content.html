        <label>GPA</label>
        <p id="gpa">
          GPA is the unified way that high schools represent a student's grades
          with a single number. The calculation considers all grades (generally
          by semester) from 9th to 12th grade. It is usually goes from 0 to 4.0
          or 0 to 6.0 depending on if it is unweighted or weighted.
        </p>
        <label id="gpa1">Unweighted GPA</label>
        <p id="gpa2">
          The GPA that does not take class difficulty into account. All classes'
          grades count the same, regardless of rigor.
        </p>
        <label id="gpa3">Weighted GPA</label>
        <p id="gpa4">
          The GPA that takes class difficulty into account. On a 6.0 scale, an A
          in a standard class is worth 4.0. An A in an honors (harder) class is
          worth 5.0. An A in an AP (hardest) class is worth 6.0.

        <label class="listTitle">Types of Classes</label>
        <p id="rigor">
          There are different levels of difficulty to classes, also referred to
          as rigor. These are standard, honors, and AP or college level.
        </p>
        <label>Standard</label>
        <p id="rigor1">
          This is the most common (and easiest) class type and it is worth a
          maximum of 4.0 on either of your GPAs.
        </p>
        <label>Honors</label>
        <p id="rigor2">
          Also referred to as Pre-AICE or Pre-AP, these classes move at a faster
          pace and require some independent work. These are worth 4.0 on your
          unweighted GPA and 5.0 on your weighted GPA.
        </p>
        <label>AP</label>
        <p id="rigor3">
          Also known as college level or AICE, these are the most advanced and
          rigorous classes. They are worth a 4.0 unweighted GPA and 6.0 weighted
          GPA.
        </p>
        <label>Dual Enrollment</label>
        <p id="rigor4">
          These are ACTUAL college classes, which means they offer a broader
          range of subjects, but taking these counts towards your college GPA
          and therefore is an important decision. They are generally worth the
          same as Honors classes for GPA.

        <label>SAT</label>
        <p id="st1">
          The SAT is the major test used in college admissions. It is a multiple
          choice test that can be taken as many times as needed, but there is a
          fee. Usually, the school offers two free SATs for students on
          predetermined dates. This test has a score range of 400-1600 composed
          by two sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="st2">Math (200-800)</li>
          <li id="st3">Reading & Writing (200-800)</li>
        </ul>
        <label>ACT</label>
        <p id="st4">
          The ACT is the most popular alternative to the SAT and is also
          accepted by all colleges that accept the SAT. It is a multiple choice
          test with a score range of 1-36 that also has a fee. It has the
          following sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li id="st5">English (1-36)</li>
          <li id="st6">Math (1-36)</li>
          <li id="st7">Reading (1-36)</li>
          <li id="st8">Science (1-36)</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="st9">
          The composite score is the average of section scores rounded to the
          nearest whole number
